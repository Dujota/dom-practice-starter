- Run the code using VS Code `live server` or by opening the `.html` file in your browser.
- Take a look at the **mock up** [solution demo](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/taylor-darneille/dom-events-solution/). (Ignore the horizontal lines that appear under the icons on hover for now. You will have the option of creating those later in the **Stretch Goals** section)
